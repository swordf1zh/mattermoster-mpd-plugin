## Setting a Custom Slash Command in Mattermost

To create a Custom Slash Command, follow this instructions from [Mattermost's documentation](https://docs.mattermost.com/developer/slash-commands.html#custom-slash-command):

In Mattermost client (web or desktop application)...

1 - First, go to **Main Menu** > **Integrations** > **Slash Commands**. If you donâ€™t have the Integrations option in your Main Menu, slash commands may not be enabled on your Mattermost server or may be disabled for non-admins. Enable them from **System Console** > **Integrations** > **Custom Integrations** or ask your System Administrator to do so.

2 - Click **Add Slash Command** and add name and description for the command.

3 - Set the **Command Trigger Word**. The trigger word must be unique and cannot begin with a slash or contain any spaces. It also cannot be one of the built-in commands.

4 - Set the **Request URL** and **Request Method**. The request URL is the endpoint that Mattermost hits to reach your application, and the request method is either POST or GET and specifies the type of request sent to the request URL.

> Note:
>
> This is the host:port of your Mattermoster API server.
>
> **Request Method** must be set to POST.

5 - (Optional) Set the response username and icon the command will post messages as in Mattermost. If not set, the command will use your username and profile picture.

6 - (Optional) Include the slash command in the command autocomplete list, displayed when typing / in an empty input box. Use it to make your command easier to discover by your teammates. You can also provide a hint listing the arguments of your command and a short description displayed in the autocomplete list.

7 - Hit Save.

You are done. Now try your new **Custom Slash Command** in any channel or direct message in Mattermost.

## Troubleshooting

If you are running Mattermoster in the same machine that is running Mattermost, you must modify Mattermost's config.json file to [allow unstrusted internal connections](https://docs.mattermost.com/administration/config-settings.html#allow-untrusted-internal-connections-to).
